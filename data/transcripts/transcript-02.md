**[00:00:00]**  
**Representative:** Thank you for calling MedBridge Pharmacy Benefits. This is Marcus. How may I assist you today?

**[00:00:05]**  
**Customer:** Hi, yes, I'm calling about a claim that was denied. I'm really confused about why.

**[00:00:12]**  
**Representative:** I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your member ID number please?

**[00:00:17]**  
**Customer:** Sure, it's MB-552194.

**[00:00:23]**  
**Representative:** Thank you, Ms. Rodriguez. And can you verify your date of birth for security purposes?

**[00:00:29]**  
**Customer:** March 15th, 1978.

**[00:00:33]**  
**Representative:** Perfect, thank you. Now, which medication claim are we looking at?

**[00:00:38]**  
**Customer:** It's for my daughter's EpiPen. We tried to fill it last week and it was denied. The pharmacy said something about it being too soon?

**[00:00:48]**  
**Representative:** Okay, let me pull up the claim details... I see it here. The denial reason is "refill too soon." It looks like an EpiPen 2-pack was filled on July 30th, and this new claim was submitted on October 21st.

**[00:01:05]**  
**Customer:** Right, but here's the thing - one of the EpiPens expired. They have a short shelf life, and one of them from the last pack was actually close to expiring when we got it.

**[00:01:18]**  
**Representative:** I understand. EpiPens typically have a 12 to 18 month shelf life from the date of manufacture. Our system shows the last fill was about three months ago, so it's triggering the early refill block.

**[00:01:32]**  
**Customer:** But my daughter has a severe peanut allergy. We can't be without an unexpired EpiPen. She's in middle school and they require us to have one at school and one at home.

**[00:01:44]**  
**Representative:** Absolutely, I completely understand how critical this is. Let me check a few things. Do you have the lot number from the expired EpiPen by any chance?

**[00:01:55]**  
**Customer:** Um, I might. Let me look... Yes, I took a picture of it. It's lot number 2304578.

**[00:02:08]**  
**Representative:** That's very helpful, thank you. And what's the expiration date shown on it?

**[00:02:14]**  
**Customer:** It says November 2025, so it's technically not expired yet, but it's only got a couple weeks left and we need to make sure she has a current one.

**[00:02:25]**  
**Representative:** I see. So the medication itself isn't expired yet, which is why the system denied it as too early. However, we do have provisions for early fills in certain circumstances, especially for emergency medications.

**[00:02:40]**  
**Customer:** Okay, so what do we need to do? Her school has been asking me about this.

**[00:02:46]**  
**Representative:** Well, since your daughter needs one at school and one at home, and you're within 30 days of the expiration, I can submit an override request. But I'm also seeing something else here - does your daughter's doctor's prescription specify a quantity of four EpiPens?

**[00:03:05]**  
**Customer:** I'm not sure. Why would it be four?

**[00:03:09]**  
**Representative:** Many allergists will prescribe four for children - two for school and two for home - specifically because of situations like this. If the prescription is written that way, you'd be covered for more frequent refills.

**[00:03:24]**  
**Customer:** Oh, I didn't know that. I think the prescription just says "EpiPen 2-pack, as needed."

**[00:03:32]**  
**Representative:** Got it. Here's what I'd recommend. For the immediate situation, I can process an early refill override based on the pending expiration. That should get you the 2-pack right away. But for the future, you might want to ask her doctor to write a new prescription for a quantity of four with instructions for multiple locations.

**[00:03:55]**  
**Customer:** That makes sense. So you can get this approved today?

**[00:04:00]**  
**Representative:** Yes, I'm submitting the override right now... Okay, it's approved. You should be able to go back to your pharmacy and have them resubmit the claim. It should go through now.

**[00:04:13]**  
**Customer:** Oh wonderful, thank you so much! What pharmacy do I need to go to?

**[00:04:19]**  
**Representative:** The claim was originally submitted to CVS on Maple Street. Is that your usual pharmacy?

**[00:04:26]**  
**Customer:** Yes, that's the one.

**[00:04:28]**  
**Representative:** Perfect. They should be able to reprocess it immediately. Your copay will be $60 for the 2-pack.

**[00:04:36]**  
**Customer:** Okay, that's fine. And you mentioned I should talk to her doctor about getting four instead of two?

**[00:04:43]**  
**Representative:** Yes, exactly. If her doctor writes the prescription for a quantity of four with a note indicating they're needed for multiple locations - school and home - then insurance would cover all four at once, and you wouldn't run into this issue with early refills.

**[00:05:00]**  
**Customer:** That's really helpful. I wish someone had told us that before. We've been dealing with this for three years now.

**[00:05:08]**  
**Representative:** I'm sorry no one mentioned it earlier. It's pretty common for pediatric allergy patients, but not everyone knows about it. Some plans even have specific programs for this.

**[00:05:20]**  
**Customer:** Does our plan have anything like that?

**[00:05:24]**  
**Representative:** Let me check your benefits... Yes, actually. Your plan has a "Chronic Condition Management" benefit that covers emergency medications at multiple locations for children. If her doctor documents the medical necessity, you could potentially get the four-pack covered with just one copay instead of two.

**[00:05:46]**  
**Customer:** Really? How do we set that up?

**[00:05:50]**  
**Representative:** Your daughter's doctor would need to complete a Prior Authorization form - similar to what I mentioned for the quantity increase. They'd explain why she needs multiple EpiPens at different locations due to her allergy severity. Once approved, it's good for a year and then needs to be renewed.

**[00:06:10]**  
**Customer:** Is that something you can start for me, or do I need to call the doctor first?

**[00:06:16]**  
**Representative:** I can initiate it from our end. I'll send the form to - let me see who prescribed this - Dr. Amanda Chen at Westside Allergy Associates?

**[00:06:27]**  
**Customer:** Yes, that's her allergist.

**[00:06:30]**  
**Representative:** Perfect. I'm sending the prior authorization form to their office now. I'll also include a cover sheet explaining the benefit and what documentation they need to provide. You should probably give them a call in a day or two to make sure they received it and see if they need any information from you.

**[00:06:50]**  
**Customer:** Okay, I can do that. This is so much more helpful than I expected. I was prepared to just pay out of pocket.

**[00:06:58]**  
**Representative:** I'm glad I could help! Is the doctor's fax number still 555-0392?

**[00:07:05]**  
**Customer:** I think so, yes. That sounds right.

**[00:07:09]**  
**Representative:** Okay, it's sent. You should receive a confirmation letter in the mail within a few days explaining what was submitted. The prior authorization review typically takes about five business days, but it could be sooner.

**[00:07:24]**  
**Customer:** And in the meantime, I can pick up the two-pack today?

**[00:07:28]**  
**Representative:** Correct. The override I submitted is active immediately, so you're all set for this fill. The prior authorization is for future fills, to make the process easier and potentially more cost-effective.

**[00:07:42]**  
**Customer:** Perfect. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain all of this. I've called insurance companies before and just gotten the runaround.

**[00:07:51]**  
**Representative:** You're very welcome, Ms. Rodriguez. I know dealing with insurance can be frustrating, especially when it involves your child's safety. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

**[00:08:02]**  
**Customer:** Actually, yes. One more quick question - do EpiPens ever go on some kind of cheaper list? The $60 copay is manageable, but it adds up when we're replacing them multiple times a year.

**[00:08:17]**  
**Representative:** That's a great question. EpiPens are already on our specialty tier, which is actually the best available for brand-name emergency medications. There are some authorized generic versions that might be less expensive - let me check if those are on your formulary...

**[00:08:35]**  
**Representative:** Yes, Epinephrine auto-injector, which is the authorized generic, is covered at a lower tier. Your copay would be $30 instead of $60.

**[00:08:45]**  
**Customer:** Oh wow, that's half the price! Can I get that instead?

**[00:08:50]**  
**Representative:** You can, but it would need to be prescribed specifically. The doctor would need to write a new prescription for "Epinephrine auto-injector" or check the "substitution allowed" box on the EpiPen prescription. The medication is exactly the same - same dose, same mechanism.

**[00:09:08]**  
**Customer:** I'll definitely ask about that. So I should mention both things to Dr. Chen - the quantity increase to four, and switching to the generic version?

**[00:09:18]**  
**Representative:** Exactly. Both of those things together could save you quite a bit of money. If you get four of the generic version approved through the prior authorization, you'd pay $30 total instead of $120 for multiple fills.

**[00:09:35]**  
**Customer:** That's amazing. Thank you so much for letting me know about all of this!

**[00:09:41]**  
**Representative:** Of course! I'm going to send you a summary email with all the information we discussed today - the override approval, the prior authorization I submitted, and the notes about the generic option. Is the email on file still teresa.rodriguez@email.com?

**[00:09:58]**  
**Customer:** Yes, that's correct.

**[00:10:01]**  
**Representative:** Perfect. You should receive that within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help with?

**[00:10:08]**  
**Customer:** No, I think that covers everything. You've been incredibly helpful, Marcus. Thank you.

**[00:10:14]**  
**Representative:** It's my pleasure, Ms. Rodriguez. I hope your daughter stays safe and healthy. If you have any issues at the pharmacy or any other questions, please don't hesitate to call back.

**[00:10:25]**  
**Customer:** I will. Thanks again!

**[00:10:27]**  
**Representative:** You're welcome. Have a great day!

**[00:10:30]**  
**Customer:** You too. Bye!

**[00:10:32]**  
**Representative:** Goodbye.
