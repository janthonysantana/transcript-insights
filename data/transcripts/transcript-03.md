**[00:00:00]**  
**Representative:** Thank you for calling MedBridge Pharmacy Benefits. This is Jennifer. May I have your member ID?

**[00:00:06]**  
**Customer:** Yeah, it's MB-338967. Look, I don't have a lot of time, so let's make this quick.

**[00:00:14]**  
**Representative:** Of course, I'll do my best to help you efficiently. Can I have your date of birth for verification?

**[00:00:20]**  
**Customer:** June 22nd, 1985.

**[00:00:24]**  
**Representative:** Thank you, Mr. Patterson. What can I help you with today?

**[00:00:28]**  
**Customer:** I need to know why my wife's prescription costs $340. That's insane. It was $25 last month.

**[00:00:36]**  
**Representative:** I understand that's a significant difference. Let me look up the claim. What's your wife's name?

**[00:00:42]**  
**Customer:** Rebecca Patterson.

**[00:00:45]**  
**Representative:** And do you know which medication this is for?

**[00:00:48]**  
**Customer:** It's her birth control. I don't remember the name. Something with an L.

**[00:00:53]**  
**Representative:** Okay, let me pull up her recent claims... I see a claim here for Loestrin from yesterday. Is that the one?

**[00:01:02]**  
**Customer:** Yeah, that sounds right. Why did it go from $25 to $340?

**[00:01:08]**  
**Representative:** Let me check the details... Okay, I can see what happened. The claim processed at the out-of-network rate because it was filled at a pharmacy that's not in our network.

**[00:01:20]**  
**Customer:** What are you talking about? We always go to the same pharmacy. We've been going there for two years.

**[00:01:27]**  
**Representative:** Which pharmacy did you use?

**[00:01:30]**  
**Customer:** Riverside Pharmacy on Johnson Street. Same place we always go.

**[00:01:36]**  
**Representative:** Let me check our network... I see. Riverside Pharmacy was in our network, but they were removed effective October 1st due to a contract dispute.

**[00:01:48]**  
**Customer:** That's ridiculous. So you're telling me we can't use our pharmacy anymore? Nobody told us anything about this.

**[00:01:56]**  
**Representative:** I apologize for the confusion. Network changes are typically communicated through mail and email notifications, but I understand those can be easy to miss. There are several other pharmacies in your area that are in-network.

**[00:02:11]**  
**Customer:** I don't want to go to another pharmacy. We like Riverside. They know us there. This is absurd.

**[00:02:18]**  
**Representative:** I understand your frustration, Mr. Patterson. Unfortunately, the network changes are determined by contract negotiations between the pharmacy and the insurance plan, and that's outside of our control as the benefits administrator.

**[00:02:33]**  
**Customer:** So what am I supposed to do? Pay $340 every month now?

**[00:02:38]**  
**Representative:** No, you have a couple options. You can transfer your prescriptions to an in-network pharmacy where the copay would go back to $25. Or, if you prefer to stay at Riverside, you would continue to pay the out-of-network rate.

**[00:02:54]**  
**Customer:** Can you at least cover this one since nobody told us?

**[00:03:00]**  
**Representative:** Unfortunately, I don't have the ability to override out-of-network claims retroactively. The notification was sent to all members on September 15th, and there was a 15-day grace period where Riverside was still processing as in-network.

**[00:03:18]**  
**Customer:** Well, we didn't get any notification. Can you check?

**[00:03:22]**  
**Representative:** The notification would have been sent to... let me see... 2847 Maple Avenue, and to the email address dpatterson@techmail.com. Does that sound correct?

**[00:03:36]**  
**Customer:** Yeah, that's our address. But I'm telling you, we never got anything.

**[00:03:42]**  
**Representative:** I understand, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, once the notifications are sent, I can't adjust claims based on non-receipt. But what I can do is help you find a convenient in-network pharmacy for future fills.

**[00:03:58]**  
**Customer:** This is unbelievable. So I'm just out $315?

**[00:04:04]**  
**Representative:** The prescription has already been dispensed at the out-of-network rate. However, for future fills, if you switch to an in-network pharmacy, you'll go back to your $25 copay.

**[00:04:17]**  
**Customer:** What pharmacies are even in your network? Probably none that are convenient.

**[00:04:23]**  
**Representative:** Actually, there are quite a few options. Within two miles of your address, you have CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid, and Costco Pharmacy. All of those are in-network.

**[00:04:36]**  
**Customer:** Fine. CVS is nearby I guess. How do we transfer the prescription?

**[00:04:43]**  
**Representative:** You can either call CVS directly and ask them to transfer it from Riverside, or you can ask Riverside to transfer it to CVS. Either pharmacy can initiate the transfer.

**[00:04:56]**  
**Customer:** And it'll definitely be $25 there?

**[00:04:59]**  
**Representative:** Yes, as long as you use an in-network pharmacy, your copay for Loestrin will be $25 for a 30-day supply, or $50 for a 90-day supply through mail order or at certain retail locations.

**[00:05:14]**  
**Customer:** Wait, $50 for 90 days? That's cheaper than getting it monthly.

**[00:05:20]**  
**Representative:** Correct. If you fill 90-day supplies, you'd only pay $50 every three months instead of $25 every month, which saves you $25 per quarter.

**[00:05:32]**  
**Customer:** Well, that's something at least. Can CVS do 90-day fills?

**[00:05:38]**  
**Representative:** Yes, CVS can do 90-day supplies for maintenance medications like birth control. You'd just need to ask your wife's doctor to send a new prescription for a 90-day supply with refills.

**[00:05:52]**  
**Customer:** Okay. Is there anything you can do about this $340 charge though? Can I talk to a supervisor?

**[00:06:00]**  
**Representative:** I can certainly transfer you to a supervisor, but I want to set expectations - they have the same limitations I do regarding out-of-network claims. The policy doesn't allow for retroactive adjustments once a prescription has been dispensed out-of-network after the grace period ended.

**[00:06:20]**  
**Customer:** This is such a scam. Fine, forget it. I don't have time to sit on hold. Just... forget it.

**[00:06:28]**  
**Representative:** I'm truly sorry for the frustration, Mr. Patterson. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding the transfer to CVS or setting up the 90-day supply?

**[00:06:38]**  
**Customer:** No. I'll figure it out myself.

**[00:06:42]**  
**Representative:** Alright. Just so you have it, the CVS closest to you is at 450 Highland Avenue. If you have any issues with the transfer or need help in the future, please don't hesitate to call back.

**[00:06:56]**  
**Customer:** Yeah. Bye.

**[00:06:58]**  
**Representative:** Thank you for calling. Have a good day.
