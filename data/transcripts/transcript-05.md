**[00:00:00]**  
**Representative:** MedBridge Provider Relations, this is Ahmed Hassan speaking. How can I help you today?

**[00:00:06]**  
**Caller:** Hi Ahmed, this is Susan Martinez. I'm the pharmacy manager at Greenfield Pharmacy in Boulder, Colorado. I'm calling about several claim rejections we've been getting over the past week.

**[00:00:19]**  
**Representative:** Good morning, Susan. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can I get your NPI number?

**[00:00:26]**  
**Caller:** Sure, it's 1234567890.

**[00:00:31]**  
**Representative:** Thank you. And your pharmacy's NCPDP number?

**[00:00:36]**  
**Caller:** That's 5847921.

**[00:00:40]**  
**Representative:** Perfect, I've pulled up your account. What specific issues are you experiencing?

**[00:00:47]**  
**Caller:** We're getting a rejection code 75 on multiple claims - "prior authorization required" - but these are medications that patients have been taking for months without any issues. It started happening last Tuesday.

**[00:01:02]**  
**Representative:** Okay, rejection code 75. Do you have any specific claim numbers I can reference?

**[00:01:09]**  
**Caller:** Yes, let me pull them up... Claim number 2025-10-22-847392, that was for atorvastatin. Then 2025-10-23-903847 for metformin, and 2025-10-24-771023 for lisinopril. All different patients, all rejecting for prior auth.

**[00:01:33]**  
**Representative:** Let me look these up... Okay, I'm seeing the rejections. These are all generic medications that normally don't require prior authorization. Let me check if there was a formulary update... Ah, I see what's happening.

**[00:01:52]**  
**Caller:** What is it?

**[00:01:54]**  
**Representative:** There was a system update on October 21st that affected quantity limits on certain maintenance medications. It looks like the claims you're submitting are exceeding the new quantity limits, which is triggering the prior authorization requirement.

**[00:02:12]**  
**Caller:** Quantity limits? These are standard 90-day supplies that we've been filling forever. Nobody told us about any changes.

**[00:02:21]**  
**Representative:** I understand your frustration. Let me check the notification log... A bulletin was sent to all network pharmacies on October 1st about the upcoming changes, with an effective date of October 21st. Did your pharmacy receive that?

**[00:02:39]**  
**Caller:** We get about fifty bulletins a week from various PBMs. Can you tell me what the new limits are?

**[00:02:47]**  
**Representative:** The new policy limits certain chronic maintenance medications to 30-day supplies at retail pharmacies. 90-day supplies are still available through mail order or at designated retail locations for 90-day fills.

**[00:03:04]**  
**Caller:** That's ridiculous. So now our patients have to come in three times as often? That's going to create a huge burden on them and on us.

**[00:03:14]**  
**Representative:** I understand the concern. The policy change was implemented to encourage utilization of the 90-day mail order program, which has lower dispensing fees and copays for members. However, certain retail pharmacies can apply to become designated 90-day retail providers.

**[00:03:35]**  
**Caller:** And how do we apply for that? This is the first I'm hearing about it.

**[00:03:41]**  
**Representative:** The application process was outlined in the October 1st bulletin. I can resend that to you, or I can walk you through the requirements now if you have a few minutes?

**[00:03:53]**  
**Caller:** Just give me the basics. What do we need to do?

**[00:03:58]**  
**Representative:** You need to submit an application demonstrating that your pharmacy meets certain criteria: a minimum prescription volume of 3,000 per month, automated dispensing systems for accuracy, adherence counseling programs, and you need to agree to the 90-day pricing structure, which has lower reimbursement rates.

**[00:04:24]**  
**Caller:** Lower reimbursement rates? So we'd be doing more work for less money?

**[00:04:30]**  
**Representative:** The reimbursement per prescription is lower, but you'd be dispensing fewer total prescriptions since each one covers 90 days instead of 30. The idea is that it balances out.

**[00:04:43]**  
**Caller:** That's easy to say, but we still have the same overhead costs, the same staff time for counseling, the same inventory carrying costs - actually higher inventory costs because we're holding 90 days of medication instead of 30.

**[00:04:59]**  
**Representative:** I understand those are legitimate business concerns. The policy decisions are made at a higher level than Provider Relations, but I can document your feedback and escalate it to our network management team.

**[00:05:15]**  
**Caller:** Please do. In the meantime, what are we supposed to tell patients who come in expecting their 90-day fills?

**[00:05:23]**  
**Representative:** For existing prescriptions, you have a couple of options. You can fill them as 30-day supplies, or you can submit a prior authorization request on behalf of the patient if they have a medical reason for needing retail 90-day fills - for example, if they don't have a permanent address for mail delivery.

**[00:05:45]**  
**Caller:** How long do prior auths take?

**[00:05:48]**  
**Representative:** Standard turnaround is 72 hours, but you can request expedited review for urgent situations, which is typically 24 hours.

**[00:05:58]**  
**Caller:** So patients either go without medication for three days, or we give them a partial fill and they make multiple trips. This is going to cause so many problems.

**[00:06:10]**  
**Representative:** For continuity of care, you can process an emergency supply while the prior auth is pending. You'd submit the claim with the override code ER, and that should allow a 10-day supply to go through immediately.

**[00:06:26]**  
**Caller:** Okay, that's somewhat helpful. Can you send me documentation on all of these override codes and the prior auth process?

**[00:06:35]**  
**Representative:** Absolutely. I'll send you the provider manual section on quantity limits, override codes, and the prior authorization submission process. What's the best email address?

**[00:06:47]**  
**Caller:** susan.martinez@greenfieldpharmacy.com

**[00:06:53]**  
**Representative:** Got it. I'm sending that now... Okay, you should have it in the next few minutes. I'm also including the application for becoming a 90-day retail provider.

**[00:07:06]**  
**Caller:** Thanks. I have another issue while I have you on the phone. We've had several claims that are reversing days or even weeks after they were processed. What's going on with that?

**[00:07:20]**  
**Representative:** Claim reversals after the fact? Can you give me some examples?

**[00:07:26]**  
**Caller:** Claim 2025-10-08-556483 was processed and paid on October 8th, then reversed on October 24th with a code 76 - "Plan limitations exceeded."

**[00:07:42]**  
**Representative:** Let me pull that specific claim... Okay, I see it. This was for Humira, a specialty medication. The reversal was triggered because the member reached their annual specialty medication cap.

**[00:07:59]**  
**Caller:** But that should have been caught when we submitted the claim originally, not two weeks later. We've already given the patient the medication. Now we're out $4,800.

**[00:08:12]**  
**Representative:** I see your concern. What happened here is that multiple claims from different pharmacies were processed simultaneously around the same time, and when the final adjudication occurred, this claim pushed the member over their cap.

**[00:08:30]**  
**Caller:** So what are we supposed to do? We can't get the medication back from the patient.

**[00:08:37]**  
**Representative:** You have the right to bill the patient directly for the reversed amount, as it's their responsibility under the plan limitations. However, I know that's not an ideal situation. Let me check if there's any reconsideration process... One moment.

**[00:08:56]**  
**Caller:** The patient has no idea they've hit some cap. They're going to be blindsided by a $4,800 bill.

**[00:09:04]**  
**Representative:** I understand. Unfortunately, members are responsible for knowing their plan limitations, and they should have received notification when they were approaching their cap. However, let me see if we can work something out given the timing issue.

**[00:09:23]**  
**Caller:** I'd appreciate that. This isn't fair to us or to the patient.

**[00:09:28]**  
**Representative:** I'm going to escalate this to our claims resolution team. What I need from you is to submit a dispute form - I'll email that to you as well - explaining the situation and the timing of the reversal. Include the original claim date, the date you dispensed the medication, and the date of the reversal.

**[00:09:51]**  
**Caller:** And what happens then?

**[00:09:54]**  
**Representative:** The claims resolution team will review whether there was a system error in the original processing. If they determine that the claim should have been rejected at the point of sale, they may issue a pharmacy payment as a one-time exception, and the member would be responsible for reimbursing their plan.

**[00:10:17]**  
**Caller:** How long does that review take?

**[00:10:21]**  
**Representative:** Typically 10 to 15 business days. I can flag it as urgent given the amount involved.

**[00:10:29]**  
**Caller:** Please do. We're a small independent pharmacy. We can't absorb losses like this.

**[00:10:36]**  
**Representative:** I completely understand. I'm making notes in the system now and marking it for urgent review. Is there anything else you need help with today?

**[00:10:48]**  
**Caller:** Not right now, but I'm sure I'll be calling back. These system changes are causing chaos in our pharmacy.

**[00:10:56]**  
**Representative:** I hear you, and I'm sorry for the disruption. Just to recap, you'll be receiving several emails from me: the provider manual sections on quantity limits and overrides, the 90-day retail provider application, the claim dispute form, and I'm also including the direct line for provider relations so you don't have to go through the main queue if you have urgent issues.

**[00:11:22]**  
**Caller:** That would be helpful, thank you.

**[00:11:25]**  
**Representative:** My direct extension is 7-4-5-3. If I'm not available, it will go to another provider relations specialist who will have access to all of these notes.

**[00:11:37]**  
**Caller:** Okay, I've got that written down. And you'll follow up on the claim reversal dispute?

**[00:11:44]**  
**Representative:** Yes, I'm submitting the escalation as soon as we hang up, and you should receive a confirmation email with a case number within an hour. You can use that case number to check on the status.

**[00:11:58]**  
**Caller:** Alright. Thanks for your help, Ahmed. I know this isn't your fault, but these policy changes are really making things difficult for independent pharmacies.

**[00:12:09]**  
**Representative:** I appreciate you sharing that feedback, Susan, and I will make sure it gets documented and sent to the appropriate teams. We value our independent pharmacy partners and want to maintain good working relationships.

**[00:12:25]**  
**Caller:** Well, I hope someone listens. We're considering dropping out of the MedBridge network if this keeps up.

**[00:12:33]**  
**Representative:** I understand that's a significant consideration. If you'd like, I can have someone from our pharmacy network contracting team reach out to discuss your concerns?

**[00:12:45]**  
**Caller:** Let me think about it. Right now I just need to deal with these immediate issues.

**[00:12:51]**  
**Representative:** Of course. The offer stands whenever you're ready. Is there anything else for today?

**[00:12:58]**  
**Caller:** No, that's everything. Thanks again.

**[00:13:02]**  
**Representative:** You're welcome, Susan. Have a good rest of your day.

**[00:13:06]**  
**Caller:** You too. Bye.

**[00:13:08]**  
**Representative:** Goodbye.
