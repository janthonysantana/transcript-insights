**[00:00:00]**  
**Representative:** Thank you for calling MedBridge Pharmacy Benefits. This is David speaking. How can I help you today?

**[00:00:07]**  
**Customer:** Oh hi! Yes, I'm hoping you can help me. I'm a little overwhelmed here.

**[00:00:13]**  
**Representative:** Of course, I'll do my best to help. Can I start by getting your member ID number?

**[00:00:19]**  
**Customer:** Sure, let me find my card... okay, it's MB... 761203.

**[00:00:28]**  
**Representative:** Thank you. And can you verify your date of birth?

**[00:00:32]**  
**Customer:** September 3rd, 1952.

**[00:00:36]**  
**Representative:** Perfect, thank you Mrs. Nakamura. What brings you in today?

**[00:00:41]**  
**Customer:** Well, my husband passed away last month, and I'm trying to figure out all of his medications. He was taking so many things, and I don't know what I'm supposed to do with his prescriptions or if I need to cancel anything.

**[00:00:58]**  
**Representative:** I'm very sorry for your loss, Mrs. Nakamura. I can definitely help you with this. First, let me offer my condolences. I know this must be a difficult time.

**[00:01:10]**  
**Customer:** Thank you, that's very kind. Yes, it's been... it's been hard. He had heart problems and diabetes, so there were a lot of medications.

**[00:01:22]**  
**Representative:** I understand. Let me pull up the account. Was your husband covered under your insurance plan, or did he have his own member ID?

**[00:01:32]**  
**Customer:** He was on my plan. Through my retirement benefits from the school district.

**[00:01:38]**  
**Representative:** Okay, I see him listed here as a dependent. His name was Robert Nakamura?

**[00:01:44]**  
**Customer:** Yes, that's right.

**[00:01:47]**  
**Representative:** Alright. So there are a few things we'll need to take care of. First, we'll need to remove him from your insurance plan. Do you have a copy of the death certificate?

**[00:01:59]**  
**Customer:** Yes, I have several copies. Do I need to send you one?

**[00:02:04]**  
**Representative:** Yes, we will need a copy for our records. You can either fax it to us, mail it, or upload it through our secure member portal. Which would be easiest for you?

**[00:02:16]**  
**Customer:** Oh dear, I don't know how to use the portal. Could I mail it? I know how to do that.

**[00:02:23]**  
**Representative:** Absolutely. I'll give you the mailing address before we hang up. Now, regarding his prescriptions - are there any automatic refills set up that are still active?

**[00:02:35]**  
**Customer:** I think so. The pharmacy keeps calling and leaving messages about refills being ready. I don't know what to do about those.

**[00:02:44]**  
**Representative:** That's okay. Which pharmacy was he using?

**[00:02:48]**  
**Customer:** Walgreens on Cedar Street. We've been going there for years.

**[00:02:53]**  
**Representative:** What I'd recommend is calling that Walgreens and letting them know about your husband's passing. They can cancel any automatic refills and remove the prescriptions from their system. Do you feel comfortable making that call?

**[00:03:09]**  
**Customer:** Yes, I think I can do that. Should I do it today?

**[00:03:14]**  
**Representative:** Whenever you're ready. There's no rush, but it would prevent any confusion with future refill notifications. Now, let me check if there are any recent claims that might still be processing... I see there was a prescription picked up on October 10th. Was that the last one?

**[00:03:36]**  
**Customer:** Yes, I think that was right before he went into the hospital.

**[00:03:42]**  
**Representative:** Okay. That claim processed normally, so there's nothing to worry about there. Now, once we receive the death certificate, we'll update our records and remove him from the plan. Your coverage will continue as normal - this won't affect your own benefits at all.

**[00:04:01]**  
**Customer:** Oh good. I was worried about that. I have my own medications too, and I can't afford to lose my insurance.

**[00:04:10]**  
**Representative:** You won't lose anything. Your individual coverage remains exactly the same. The only change is removing your husband as a dependent, which will actually lower your monthly premium slightly.

**[00:04:24]**  
**Customer:** Oh, I didn't realize that. That's... that's helpful to know.

**[00:04:30]**  
**Representative:** Yes. You should see that adjustment on your next billing statement. Now, is there anything at all with his medications that you have questions about? Any bills or anything that came in?

**[00:04:45]**  
**Customer:** Well, there was one bill from the pharmacy for $187. I wasn't sure if I needed to pay that or if insurance would cover it.

**[00:04:57]**  
**Representative:** Do you know which medication that was for?

**[00:05:01]**  
**Customer:** Let me look at the paper... it says "Eliquis." I think that was his blood thinner.

**[00:05:10]**  
**Representative:** Okay, let me look that up... I see a claim for Eliquis from October 10th. It shows it was processed and paid. The copay should have been $75. Do you have the billing statement with you?

**[00:05:27]**  
**Customer:** Yes, just a moment... it says the copay was $75, but then there's another charge for $112 for "additional quantity."

**[00:05:40]**  
**Representative:** Ah, I see what happened. Let me check the prescription details... It looks like the doctor prescribed a 90-day supply, but your husband's plan only covered 30-day supplies at retail pharmacies. The additional $112 would be for the extra 60 days at the out-of-pocket rate.

**[00:06:02]**  
**Customer:** Oh my. Do I need to pay that? Robert passed away on October 18th, so he didn't even use all of it.

**[00:06:12]**  
**Representative:** That's a very good question. Let me put you on a brief hold while I check with our billing department about this specific situation. Is that okay?

**[00:06:22]**  
**Customer:** Yes, that's fine.

**[00:06:25]**  
**[HOLD - 1:34]**

**[00:07:59]**  
**Representative:** Mrs. Nakamura? Thank you for holding.

**[00:08:02]**  
**Customer:** Yes, I'm here.

**[00:08:04]**  
**Representative:** Okay, so I spoke with our billing department. Given the circumstances, and the fact that your husband passed away within 30 days of the prescription being filled, they're willing to issue a credit for the unused portion. You would need to return the unused medication to the pharmacy, and they'll adjust the bill.

**[00:08:27]**  
**Customer:** Oh, that's wonderful! So I take the medicine back to Walgreens?

**[00:08:32]**  
**Representative:** Yes, exactly. Bring the unused medication and the billing statement to Walgreens. Let them know you need to return it due to your husband's passing, and they'll process the return and adjust the charges. You'll likely get a refund for the additional amount.

**[00:08:51]**  
**Customer:** That's very helpful. This has all been so much to figure out. You've been so patient with me.

**[00:08:59]**  
**Representative:** Of course, Mrs. Nakamura. I know you're dealing with a lot right now. Is there anything else I can help clarify?

**[00:09:08]**  
**Customer:** I don't think so. Let me make sure I have everything - I need to mail you the death certificate, call Walgreens to cancel the automatic refills, and return the unused medication for a refund?

**[00:09:22]**  
**Representative:** That's exactly right. And for the death certificate, mail it to: MedBridge Pharmacy Benefits, PO Box 5500, Chicago, Illinois, 60680. Mark the envelope "Attention: Member Services."

**[00:09:38]**  
**Customer:** Let me write that down... PO Box 5500, Chicago, 60680, Attention Member Services. Got it.

**[00:09:49]**  
**Representative:** Perfect. And if you have any other questions or concerns as you're going through this process, please don't hesitate to call us back. We're here to help.

**[00:10:01]**  
**Customer:** Thank you so much, David. You've been very kind and very helpful.

**[00:10:07]**  
**Representative:** You're very welcome, Mrs. Nakamura. Again, I'm sorry for your loss. Take care of yourself.

**[00:10:14]**  
**Customer:** Thank you. Goodbye.

**[00:10:17]**  
**Representative:** Goodbye.
