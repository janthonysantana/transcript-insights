**[00:00:00]**  
**Representative:** Thank you for calling MedBridge Pharmacy Benefits. This is Sarah speaking. May I have your member ID number please?

**[00:00:08]**  
**Customer:** Hi Sarah, yes, it's MB-447821.

**[00:00:15]**  
**Representative:** Thank you, Mr. Chen. I've pulled up your account. How can I help you today?

**[00:00:22]**  
**Customer:** Well, I'm pretty frustrated actually. I went to pick up my blood pressure medication yesterday, and they told me it's not covered anymore. I've been taking this same medication for three years.

**[00:00:35]**  
**Representative:** I'm sorry to hear you had that experience at the pharmacy. Let me look into that for you right away. Can you tell me the name of the medication?

**[00:00:43]**  
**Customer:** It's Benicar, 40 milligrams. I take it once daily.

**[00:00:50]**  
**Representative:** Okay, I see it here in your history. Let me check your current formulary... Ah, I can see what happened. Your employer's plan switched to a new formulary effective October 1st, and Benicar moved to a non-preferred tier.

**[00:01:08]**  
**Customer:** What does that mean exactly? Does my insurance just not cover it now?

**[00:01:14]**  
**Representative:** It's still covered, but it would be at a higher copay - looks like it would be $85 instead of your previous $15 copay. However, there are preferred alternatives that would maintain your $15 copay.

**[00:01:28]**  
**Customer:** Eighty-five dollars? That's ridiculous! Why didn't anyone tell me about this change?

**[00:01:35]**  
**Representative:** I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Chen. Your employer should have received communication about the formulary changes, and a notice was also mailed to your address in mid-September. But I know these things can get lost in the shuffle.

**[00:01:50]**  
**Customer:** I never got anything. So what are my options here? I need this medication.

**[00:01:56]**  
**Representative:** Absolutely. You have a few options. First, there are several preferred alternatives for high blood pressure that work similarly to Benicar. Medications like Losartan or Valsartan are on the preferred list and would be $15.

**[00:02:12]**  
**Customer:** I don't want to switch medications. What if it doesn't work the same way?

**[00:02:17]**  
**Representative:** That's a valid concern. Your second option would be to have your doctor submit a prior authorization request. If they can provide medical justification for why you specifically need Benicar, we can review it for coverage at the preferred tier.

**[00:02:33]**  
**Customer:** How long does that take?

**[00:02:36]**  
**Representative:** The standard review is typically 72 hours, but your doctor can request an expedited review if it's urgent, which is usually completed within 24 hours.

**[00:02:45]**  
**Customer:** And what am I supposed to do in the meantime? I only have a few pills left.

**[00:02:51]**  
**Representative:** I can submit a vacation override for you right now that will cover a 10-day supply at your old copay while the prior authorization is being processed. Would that help?

**[00:03:02]**  
**Customer:** Yes, that would help. Thank you. How do I get the prior authorization started?

**[00:03:09]**  
**Representative:** I can actually initiate that request on our end and fax the form directly to your doctor's office. Do you have your doctor's fax number handy?

**[00:03:18]**  
**Customer:** Um, let me check... it's Dr. Patel at Riverside Family Medicine. I don't have the fax number though.

**[00:03:27]**  
**Representative:** No problem, I can look that up in our provider directory. Just give me one moment... Okay, I found Dr. Patel's office. I'm going to send the prior authorization form to their fax at 555-0147. They'll need to fill it out and send it back to us.

**[00:03:48]**  
**Customer:** Okay. Should I call my doctor too?

**[00:03:52]**  
**Representative:** Yes, I'd recommend calling them to let them know it's coming and that it's time-sensitive. That way they can prioritize it.

**[00:04:00]**  
**Customer:** Alright. And you said you're doing something so I can get my medication today?

**[00:04:05]**  
**Representative:** Yes, exactly. I've just submitted the vacation override in the system. You can go back to your pharmacy in about 15 minutes and they should be able to process it at your $15 copay for a 10-day supply.

**[00:04:19]**  
**Customer:** Okay, that's good at least. I still think it's crazy that this changed without better notice.

**[00:04:26]**  
**Representative:** I understand, and I apologize for the confusion. These formulary changes are typically communicated to employers well in advance, but I know it doesn't always reach every member effectively. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

**[00:04:42]**  
**Customer:** No, I think that covers it. So just to confirm - I can pick up a 10-day supply today, and then I need to follow up with my doctor about the prior authorization?

**[00:04:52]**  
**Representative:** That's correct. And if you have any issues at the pharmacy, please call us back immediately and ask for me. I'll make notes on your account.

**[00:05:02]**  
**Customer:** What's your extension?

**[00:05:04]**  
**Representative:** It's extension 2847. I'm Sarah Mitchell.

**[00:05:09]**  
**Customer:** Okay, thank you Sarah. You've been helpful, even though I'm not happy about the situation.

**[00:05:15]**  
**Representative:** I appreciate that, Mr. Chen, and I completely understand your frustration. We'll do everything we can to get this resolved for you. Is there anything else before I let you go?

**[00:05:25]**  
**Customer:** No, that's it. Thanks again.

**[00:05:28]**  
**Representative:** You're welcome. Have a good day, and don't hesitate to call back if you need anything.

**[00:05:33]**  
**Customer:** Bye.

**[00:05:34]**  
**Representative:** Goodbye.
